title: A new future dead blog; so it goes

About 10 years ago I decided to axe my personal website and technical blog. 
At that moment, it felt like a good choice. The 'death of the blog' narrative 
was ubiquitous, and it seemed that the end of blogging was inevitable. Twitter 
was roaring, and the untimely demise of Google Reader delivered what looked like 
the final blow to blogs. We adapted and moved on; so it goes.

## The Shift to Twitter and Beyond

Twitter, especially in its technical sphere, felt like a 
**natural successor to my tech blog**. At that time, Stack Overflow was in its 
glory days, and Google's SERP was amazing. Information was easily discoverable, 
and I saw an opportunity to simplify my digital existence. My exhaustion with 
Wordpress nudged me in this direction, so I said fuck it; so it goes.

As years passed, the sweet taste of social media started to turn to ash.
Twitter became unbearable, and I can't pinpoint the exact moment or reason that 
tipped me over the edge, but it was definitely before the infamous, current
era. I did revisit the platform after the takeover, not out of love, or hope, 
but by the morbid curiosity akin to watching a train wreck unfold. Eventually, 
even that lost its appeal; so it goes.

Despite my bitterness, the digital world still hosts numerous amazing 
communities. Platforms like Mastodon, Discord, Matrix, IRC, and various forums 
continue to thrive. But now, I view them through a different lens: or they are 
just rapid communicating platforms, like IRC which isn't going the way of the 
Dodo anytime soon; the others? They may too, follow the path of their 
predecessors; so it goes.

## Rebuilding my Blog

The term 'blog' might not accurately describe this platform. 
It feels more akin to a personal tech pulpit â€“ a space for me to project my 
thoughts into the void, mix with a playground of projects.
There's a certain comfort in this, as even if no one else finds this useful, 
it still serves a purpose for me, as it could act as a future reference, 
or simply as a means of organizing thoughts in a way that is comprehensible to 
others, and as being so, it can be too for a future version of myself. 
After all, the present version will too cease to exist; so it goes.
